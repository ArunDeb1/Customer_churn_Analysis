-- Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using MYSQL
-- Description about the dataaset.
-- This is an IBM Telecom churn analysis dataset which consists of a total of 7043 rows. There are 4 tables naming: -
-- 1. Customer with column CustomerID, Gender, SeniorCitizen,Partner, Dependents, tenure, Tenure Group, Churn 
-- 2. Charges with column customerID, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Avg Monthly Spend, Revenure loss to churn
-- 3. Contract with column CustomerID, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, High Value Customer Flag
-- 4. Services with column CustomerID, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Total Services

-- The dataset is an One to Many type where the primary key is CustomerID which connects with the tables and each Customer is unique to many

-- Problem statement
-- The company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, which is leading to significant revenue loss and customer value decline. 
-- Management seeks a data-driven approach to identify why customers are leaving, who is most at risk, 
-- and what strategic actions can be taken to improve retention, optimize service offerings, and reduce financial impact.
